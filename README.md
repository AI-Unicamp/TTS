# Expressive Text-to-Speech

This is a repository forked from Coqui-AI (üê∏TTS ) used to research about expressive TTS in our AI-Unicamp-CPQD group. The original codes are kept in "main" branch which is not our default visualization. 

Here we keep the "unicamp' branch as our main branch, while "main" branch remains as the original and updated. You can see here the original [README.md](https://github.com/AI-Unicamp/TTS/blob/main/README.md).

# About the group

We are an expressive TTS research group located at Unicamp and CPQD (Brazil).
